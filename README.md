- 👋 Hi, I’m @amspencel or Andrew
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science. I'm looking to expand my knowledge in coding languages and systems. So far I've learned Python, Java, C, SQL. I've learned others like JS and CSS but I'm still learning. :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at UVA. I've taken Intro CS, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) I and II, Discrete Math (DMT),Computer Systems and Organization (CSO) I and II, and Software Dev Essentials. I will be taking Advanced Software Dev and Discrete Mathematics 2 this coming semester.
